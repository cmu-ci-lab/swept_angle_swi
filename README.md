## [Project website](https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/swept_angle_swi/index.html)

Code to perform {4,4}-shift phase retrieval on synthetic wavelength interferometry measurements, as described by Kotwal et al. [2023].

The file `process.m` shows an example. 

Captured measurement data is available on the [project website](https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/swept_angle_swi/index_files/dataset_public.zip).
